            <h1>About TopherTech</h1>
            <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Topher. And yes, I am the guy your cousin told you about who "fixed their computer with, like, wizard magic or something." It‚Äôs not magic‚Äîit‚Äôs just knowing which wire not to lick.</p>
            <p>Welcome to TopherTech, where one caffeine-fueled human handles everything from rogue drivers to resurrecting bricked devices. Whether you‚Äôve got a PC that won‚Äôt boot, a smart plug that‚Äôs dumber than a rock, or a ‚Äúmy Wi-Fi just hates me‚Äù situation‚Äîwe‚Äôre here to make tech your friend again.</p>

            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è What I Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Computer Repair & Optimization</h3>
                    <p>Speed up, clean up, or bring back machines from the dead (no seances required‚Äîjust safe mode and some grit).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Custom PC Building</h3>
                    <p>Need a beast for gaming, streaming, AI, or running 46 Chrome tabs with YouTube playing in the background? I‚Äôll build it. RGB included, because performance glows matter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Smart Home Setup & Automation</h3>
                    <p>From lights that obey voice commands to automating your AC like a nerdy wizard‚Äîif it plugs in and has an app, I‚Äôll make it behave.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Small Business Tech Support</h3>
                    <p>I‚Äôll keep your POS from acting like one. Full-stack support without the corporate nonsense.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Web & Script Services</h3>
                    <p>Need a quick website, automation scripts, or a bot to remind you to drink water and touch grass? I code that.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tech Consultation</h3>
                    <p>Confused about upgrades, hosting, VPNs, or why your printer only works when threatened? I do strategy, not just fixes.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="closing-section">
            <p>I run TopherTech with equal parts expertise, sarcasm, and ‚Äútry turning it off and on again‚Äù energy. Whether you're tech-savvy or tech-cursed, I‚Äôll meet you where you're at‚Äîfiguratively (and sometimes literally, if you‚Äôre local).</p>
            <p>So if your computer sounds like a jet engine, your emails won‚Äôt sync, or your smart home became self-aware‚Ä¶ hit me up. I‚Äôm probably already debugging something weird anyway.</p>
            <p>Let‚Äôs make your tech stop sucking.</p>
