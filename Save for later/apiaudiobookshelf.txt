Introduction
Audiobookshelf API and this documentation is a work in progress.

Contributions to this documentation are welcome! View API docs GitHub repo

Authentication
Audiobookshelf uses a users API token as a Bearer token for requests. For GET requests the API token can optionally be passed in as a query string.

You can find your API token by logging into the Audiobookshelf web app as an admin, go to the config → users page, and click on your account.

You may also get the API token programmatically using the Login endpoint. The API token will be in the response at response.user.token.

API request header for authentication would look like this:

Authorization: Bearer exJhbGciOiJI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vyi5NDEyODc4fQ.ZraBFohS4Tg39NszY

Optionally GET requests can use the API token like this:

https://abs.example.com/api/items/li_asdfalwkerioa?token=exJhbGciOiJI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vyi5NDEyODc4fQ.ZraBFohS4Tg39NszY

 Your API token will be much longer then the one in the examples.

OAuth2 Authorization Request
curl "https://abs.example.com/auth/openid?code_challenge=1234&code_challenge_method=S256&redirect_uri=audiobookshelf%3A%2F%2Foauth&client_id=Audiobookshelf-App&response_type=code&state=42"
Response header (depending on SSO provider)

Location: https://auth.example.com/application/o/authorize/?client_id=G9DbJqJ&scope=openid%20profile%20email&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fabs.example.com%2Fauth%2Fopenid%2Fmobile-redirect&state=2000&code_challenge=C424242&code_challenge_method=S256
This endpoint starts a standard OAuth2 flow with PKCE (required - S256; see RFC7636), to log the user in using SSO.

For the code_challenge, you must randomly generate a minimum 32-byte string called verifier (PKCE challenge). With the verifier, you can then generate the challenge. See the examples on the right side.

Also you must generate a random string and send it in the state parameter.

Code Challenge Pseudo-Code

code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))
Code Challenge plain Javascript Code (all used functions are available in NodeJS and Browsers)

function base64URLEncode(arrayBuffer) {
  let base64String = btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)))
  return base64String.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=+$/g, '')
}

async function sha256(plain) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  const data = encoder.encode(plain)
  return await window.crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data)
}

function generateRandomString() {
  var array = new Uint32Array(42)
  window.crypto.getRandomValues(array)
  return Array.from(array, (dec) => ('0' + dec.toString(16)).slice(-2)).join('') // return as hex
}

const verifier = generateRandomString()
const challenge = base64URLEncode(await sha256(verifier))

const state = generateRandomString()
On a valid request, it will return a 302-redirect (usually with a Location: header), which will point to the ABS-configured OAuth2 Provider. It will include your generated state-parameter, check if it matches. You would usually then have to open this redirect-URL in a Browser to present to the user.

Note that you will have to preserve the cookies you receive in this call for using it in /auth/openid/callback (check if you need to set a parameter for the HTTP library you are using for that).

When the user has logged in (successfully) inside the Browser, the Browser will redirect to the URL redirect_uri which should be a URL your website or app can open (like a universal app link). The call to the redirect_uri will include state and code GET parameters. Check if the state parameter is the same as above and use the code for the call to /auth/openid/callback.

Redirect URL which is opened in the user's browser by the SSO Provider

redirect_uri?code=42&state=2000

400	Bad Request	You submitted an invalid parameter
500	Internal Server Error	Error in the flow
OAuth2 Callback
curl "https://abs.example.com/auth/openid/callback?state=2000&code=42&code_verifier=1234"
The above command returns a JSON structured like this:

{
   "userDefaultLibraryId":"b2bab335-d9aa-4141-8394-fd98767504d7",
   "serverSettings":{
      "scannerFindCovers":false,

      "backupSchedule":false,
      "authOpenIDJwksURL":"https://auth.example.com/application/o/audiobookshelf/jwks/",
      "authOpenIDAutoLaunch":true,
      "…"
   },

   },
   "ereaderDevices":[]
}
This API call finalizes the OAuth2 flow. The behavior of this call depends on whether a redirect_uri was provided in the /auth/openid request:

If a redirect_uri was provided, this call returns user JSON data.
If a redirect_uri was not provided, it will redirect to /login (used internally by ABS-web).
It's important to note that the call to /auth/openid/callback is stateful. This means that the cookies set during the /auth/openid call must be sent along with this request.

Query Parameters
Parameter	Type	Default	Description
state	String	Required	The state string you generated in the first request
code	String	Required	The code you received when redirect_uri was called
code_verifier	String	Required	This is the verifier you generated when providing the code_challenge in the first request
Other parameters are ignored.

Response
Status	Meaning	Description
200	OK	Success, user data in payload
302	FOUND	Success, redirect to /login (internal use)
400	Bad Request	You have no session
401	Unauthorized	Error from the SSO provider
500	Internal Server Error	Error in the flow
Error details are provided in the response body and in ABS logs.

OAuth2 Mobile Redirect
curl "https://abs.example.com/auth/openid/mobile-redirect"
This is an internal endpoint, which should not be called directly by an application. It is intended purely for the redirection of SSO providers.

When you provide a redirect_uri in /auth/openid, ABS performs an important operation: it saves your redirect_uri and instructs the SSO provider to use /auth/openid/mobile-redirect instead. This endpoint, in turn, redirects to your original redirect_uri.

This mechanism allows ABS to provide a https callback URL, which is particularly useful for mobile apps.

This call does not require a cookie or session. It matches the redirect_uri using the state parameter.

HTTP Request
GET http://abs.example.com/auth/openid/mobile-redirect

Query Parameters
Parameter	Type	Default	Description
code	String	Required	OAuth2 state
state	String	Required	OAuth2 code
Other parameters are ignored.

Response
Status	Meaning	Description
302	REDIRECT	Success
400	Bad Request	No state or no redirect_uri associated to state
500	Internal Server Error	Error in the flow

                "description": "The masterpiece that started Terry Goodkind's New York Times bestselling epic Sword of Truth In the aftermath of the brutal murder of his father, a mysterious woman, Kahlan Amnell, appears in Richard Cypher's forest sanctuary seeking help...and more. His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble.

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

          "description": "The masterpiece that started Terry Goodkind's New York Times bestselling epic Sword of Truth In the aftermath of the brutal murder of his father, a mysterious woman, Kahlan Amnell, appears in Richard Cypher's forest sanctuary seeking help...and more. His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

            "description": "The masterpiece that started Terry Goodkind's New York Times bestselling epic Sword of Truth In the aftermath of the brutal murder of his father, a mysterious woman, Kahlan Amnell, appears in Richard Cypher's forest sanctuary seeking help...and more. His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

    "description": "Terry Goodkind is a #1 New York Times Bestselling Author and creator of the critically acclaimed masterwork, ‘The Sword of Truth’. He has written 30+ major, bestselling novels, has been published in more than 20 languages world-wide, and has sold more than 26 Million books. ‘The Sword of Truth’ is a revered literary tour de force, comprised of 17 volumes, borne from over 25 years of dedicated writing. Terry Goodkind's brilliant books are character-driven stories, with a focus on the complexity of the human psyche. Goodkind has an uncanny grasp for crafting compelling stories about people like you and me, trapped in terrifying situations. With masterful storytelling, Goodkind brings us into the lives of his characters; characters that must rise to face not only challenges, but their deepest fears. For that reason, Goodkind’s characters speak to the best and worst in all of us. While ‘The Sword of Truth’ series is confirmation enough of Goodkind’s incredible storytelling abilities, his broad talents are also clearly evident in his contemporary novels, set within our own world. His post-‘Sword of Truth’ books are a thrilling, dizzying, mix of modern narrative, with every bit of Goodkind’s masterful voice intact. The bond built between the reader and one of the world’s great authors, rises above worlds and settings, mere backdrops for Goodkind’s uniquely intricate stories of life, love, challenge, and triumph. \"My privilege in life is the joy of writing books and telling stories about people who fascinate me, the good and the bad. I am grateful to all of my readers for the critical role they play in making these books possible. Your passion is my passion, and I thank you.\" - Terry Goodkind For more, please visit: http://terrygoodkind.com",

Terry Goodkind’s debut novel, Wizard’s First Rule, was a phenomenon from the moment it was first published by Tor Books in 1994. In it, readers are drawn into the magical New World, where ordinary Westland forest guide Richard Cypher accepts his extraordinary destiny. As a Seeker of Truth, Richard is the only one who can stop the tyrannical wizard Darken Rahl from seizing the all-powerful Boxes of Orden. When the beautiful and mysterious Kahlan Amnell appears in Richard's forest seeking help, his humble world is turned on its head. After proving that he can wield the Sword of Truth, Richard knows that a confrontation with Darken Rahl looms. But Kahlan beseeches him to reach beyond his sword and invoke his inner nobility in order to face the dangerous challenges ahead.",

  "description": "Terry Goodkind is a #1 New York Times Bestselling Author and creator of the critically acclaimed masterwork, ‘The Sword of Truth’. He has written 30+ major, bestselling novels, has been published in more than 20 languages world-wide, and has sold more than 26 Million books. ‘The Sword of Truth’ is a revered literary tour de force, comprised of 17 volumes, borne from over 25 years of dedicated writing. Terry Goodkind's brilliant books are character-driven stories, with a focus on the complexity of the human psyche. Goodkind has an uncanny grasp for crafting compelling stories about people like you and me, trapped in terrifying situations. With masterful storytelling, Goodkind brings us into the lives of his characters; characters that must rise to face not only challenges, but their deepest fears. For that reason, Goodkind’s characters speak to the best and worst in all of us. While ‘The Sword of Truth’ series is confirmation enough of Goodkind’s incredible storytelling abilities, his broad talents are also clearly evident in his contemporary novels, set within our own world. His post-‘Sword of Truth’ books are a thrilling, dizzying, mix of modern narrative, with every bit of Goodkind’s masterful voice intact. The bond built between the reader and one of the world’s great authors, rises above worlds and settings, mere backdrops for Goodkind’s uniquely intricate stories of life, love, challenge, and triumph. \"My privilege in life is the joy of writing books and telling stories about people who fascinate me, the good and the bad. I am grateful to all of my readers for the critical role they play in making these books possible. Your passion is my passion, and I thank you.\" - Terry Goodkind For more, please visit: http://terrygoodkind.com",

Socket
Audiobookshelf uses Socket.io for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. Each client must first authenticate itself using a user's API token in order to subscribe to events for that user. There is also an example for how to use the socket.

 If the socket gets disconnected and then re-connects, it will have a new socket ID and will need to authenticate again.
Client Events
auth

socket.emit('auth', 'exJhbGciOiJI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vyi5NDEyODc4fQ.ZraBFohS4Tg39NszY')
cancel_scan

socket.emit('cancel_scan', 'lib_c1u6t4p45c35rf0nzd')
set_log_listener

socket.emit('set_log_listener', 2)
message_all_users

socket.emit('message_all_users', { message: 'Message from admin' })
These are events that clients can emit. See Miscellaneous Events for events that the server responds to these events with.

Filtering
Most filters are composed of two parts, a group and a value, put together as group.value.

The groups are:

genres
tags
series
authors
progress
narrators
missing
languages
tracks
The series, authors, narrators, missing, and tracks groups only apply to books.

The available values depend on the group:

For the genres, tags, narrators, and languages groups, the value is what genre, tag, narrator, or language to filter by.
For the series and authors groups, the value is the ID of the series or author.
For the series group, the value can also be no-series.
For the progress group, the value can be:
finished
not-started
not-finished
in-progress
For the missing group, the value can be:
asin
isbn
subtitle
authors
publishedYear
series
description
genres
tags
narrators
publisher
language
For the tracks group, the value can be:
single
multi
All values must be first Base64 encoded and then URL encoded.

Other filters are issues and feed-open.

Examples:

To filter for the Sci Fi genre:
Sci Fi is Base64 encoded as U2NpIEZp
Already URL encoded.
Then use filter=genres.U2NpIEZp.
To filter for the author Terry Goodkind who has the ID of aut_z3leimgybl7uf3y4ab:
aut_z3leimgybl7uf3y4ab is Base64 encoded as YXV0X3ozbGVpbWd5Ymw3dWYzeTRhYg==.
YXV0X3ozbGVpbWd5Ymw3dWYzeTRhYg== is URL encoded as YXV0X3ozbGVpbWd5Ymw3dWYzeTRhYg%3D%3D.
Then use filter=authors.YXV0X3ozbGVpbWd5Ymw3dWYzeTRhYg%3D%3D.
To filter for in progress items:
in-progress is Base64 encoded as aW4tcHJvZ3Jlc3M=.
aW4tcHJvZ3Jlc3M= is URL encoded as aW4tcHJvZ3Jlc3M%3D.
Then use filter=progress.aW4tcHJvZ3Jlc3M%3D.
To filter for items with their RSS feed open:
Use filter=feed-open.

In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims.
